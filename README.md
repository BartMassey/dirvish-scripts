# Dirvish scripts

These scripts provide a usable setup of the
[Dirvish](http://dirvish.org) backup system for UNIX/Linux
hosts. In particular, they correct a number of important or
merely irritating defects in the scripting as it stands:

* Adding a new machine to Dirvish backup requires a number
  of detailed and error-prone steps.

* Adding a new partition to Dirvish backup requires a number
  of detailed and error-prone steps.

* Diagnosis of Dirvish problems is difficult due to lack of
  usable instrumentation.

* Encrypted backups and media changes have no native support
  in Dirvish.

Unfortunately, these scripts are currently not ready for
general use. While they work fine in my reasonably complex
home backup environment, I have not yet done the necessary
generalization and automation to make them usable by others.

I expect to correct that problem shortly. In the meantime,
I wanted to get the scripting up.
